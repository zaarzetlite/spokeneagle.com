### Here are 10 amazing Taylor swift bridges:

###  1. All too well
_Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up  
Runnin' scared, I was there  
I remember it all too well  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest  
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all_

### 2. You're losing me
_How long could we be a sad song  
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?  
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy  
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier  
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me  
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)  
And I wouldn't marry me either  
A pathological people pleaser  
Who only wanted you to see her  
And I'm fadin', thinkin'  
"Do something, babe, say something" (Say something)  
"Lose something, babe, risk something" (You're losin' me)  
"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" (I got nothing)  
"To believe, unless you're choosin' me"_

### 3. Cruel summer
_I'm drunk in the back of the car  
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)  
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true  
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you  
And I snuck in through the garden gate  
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)  
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth  
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"  
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil_

### 4. Would've Could've Shoud've
_God rest my soul  
I miss who I used to be  
The tomb won't close  
Stained glass windows in my mind  
I regret you all the time  
I can't let this go  
I fight with you in my sleep   
The wound won't close  
I keep on waiting for a sign  
I regret you all the time_

_If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?  
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts  
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first_

### 5. Champagne problems
_Your Midas touch on the Chevy door  
November flush and your flannel cure  
"This dorm was once a madhouse"  
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"  
How evergreen, our group of friends  
Don't think we'll say that word again  
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls  
That we once walked through  
One for the money, two for the show  
I never was ready so I watch you go  
Sometimes you just don't know the answer  
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you  
"She would've made such a lovely bride  
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said  
But you'll find the real thing instead  
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred_

### 6. Illicit affairs
_And you wanna scream  
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"  
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me  
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else  
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"  
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me  
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else_

### 7. Wildest dreams
_You'll see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burnin' it down  
Someday, when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
You'll see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)  
Someday, when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow (Follow) you (You) around  
(Follow you around)_

### 8. Enchanted
_This is me praying that  
This was the very first page  
Not where the storyline ends  
My thoughts will echo your name  
Until I see you again  
These are the words I held back  
As I was leaving too soon  
I was enchanted to meet you  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)_

### 9. You belong with me
_Oh, I remember you driving to my house  
In the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh  
When you know you're 'bout to cry  
And I know your favorite songs  
And you tell me 'bout your dreams  
Think I know where you belong  
Think I know it's with me_

### 10. Death by a Thousand Cuts
_My heart, my hips, my body, my love  
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch  
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug  
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club  
Our songs, our films, united we stand  
Our country, guess it was a lawless land  
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand  
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans  
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust  
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up  
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough  
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts_
