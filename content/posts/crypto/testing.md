`- Weekly Change: +63.27%`  
`- Market Cap: $530,821,623`

Thor chain gained 48.8% raise in this week making it the top performer of the week. The project is a decentralized liquidity network that allows users to swap assets across different blockchains.

THORChain recently released a major update called "Valhalla". This update includes a number of improvements to the THORChain network, such as faster transaction speeds and increased security. Valhalla has been well-received by the crypto community, and it is likely that this has contributed to the recent price increase of RUNE.

`- Weekly Change: +26.09%`  
`- Market Cap: $2,395,563,309`

Hedera is a distributed ledger platform that uses a unique consensus mechanism called Hashgraph to achieve high throughput, low latency, and energy efficiency. It is designed to be a secure and scalable platform for building decentralized applications.

In July, Hedera announced that it had partnered with Google Cloud to create a new decentralized data marketplace. This partnership is seen as a major endorsement of Hedera's technology, and it is likely to have a positive impact on the price of HBAR.
Also, Hedera is a very well funded project with a lot of potential.
